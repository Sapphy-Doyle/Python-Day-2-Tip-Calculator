Day 2 project of the 100 Days of Code: Python Challenge. A simple tip calculator.
<br/>A simple little project that allows the user to input bill amounts, participants, and tip value. 
<br/>To produce a share of the cost to each person sharing the bill, after tip percentage has been added.
<br/>I used this to practice some basic functions and calculations.
